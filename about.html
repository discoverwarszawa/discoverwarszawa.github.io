		<p>Discover Warszawa is a personal project started out of a desire to learn more about this city.</p>
		<p>Having frequently visited the city for two years, between 2013 and 2015, I have taken the plunge to move here on a permanent basis. Over those two years I visited many interesting places, and quite often forget where I have been.</p>
		<p>Discover Warszawa is a place to make note of my movements, mainly as a way for myself to remember and be able to recommend to friends and family. I also hope residents and visitors to this city are able to use this resource as a way to find new places to visit.</p>
