Czytelnia is a beautiful, small cafe located a few minutes walk from Stare Bielany metro station on aleja Zjednoczenia.

On offer are alternative methods of brewing coffee, including AeroPress and Chemex. There are also various varieties of teas available, along with cakes and tarts.

The atmosphere has been extremely friendly each time I visited, and there has been no problem with communicating in English.
