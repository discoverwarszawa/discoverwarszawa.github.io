Zagagdka was one of the first places I enjoyed when I came to Warsaw. It's located on the edge of Wola, a short bike ride from the city center.

There are two floors and a few seperate rooms available to sit for a quiet coffee. The main reason I come here though, is for the food. They serve great breakfast choices, and generally a good selection of smaller meals such as quesadillas.

The staff are always very friendly, and all seem to speak good English.
